## Project Description
This project analyzes genomic scaffold data and protein database records using bash command-line tools. The analysis includes:
- Counting and filtering DNA sequences from FASTA files
- Identifying high-quality scaffolds based on length and coverage criteria
- Extracting and analyzing protein information from database files
- Automating bioinformatics workflows with bash scripts

## Requirements

### Software
- Bash shell (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows)
- Git and GitHub account
- Basic Unix tools: `grep`, `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, `head`, `tail`
- Text editor (nano, vim, VS Code, etc.)

### Data Files
The `Data/` directory contains:
1. **IP-004_S38_L001_scaffolds.fasta** (~10 MB) - Genomic scaffolds from sequencing assembly
2. **humchrx.txt** (~152 KB) - UniProt protein entries for human chromosome X

---

## Usage Instructions

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [YOUR_REPO_URL]
   cd bash_miniproject
   ```

2. Verify data files are present:
   ```bash
   ls -lh Data/
   ```

### Running the Scripts

[TODO: Add detailed instructions for each script as you create them. Example format below:]

#### Script 1: Extract Headers
```bash
./scripts/extract_headers.sh
```
**Purpose**: Extracts all sequence headers from the FASTA file
**Output**: `results/sequence_ids.txt` - List of NODE identifiers

#### Script 2: Find Longest Sequence
```bash
./scripts/longest_sequence.sh
```
**Purpose**: Identifies the scaffold with the longest sequence
**Output**: `results/longest_sequence.txt` - Details of the longest scaffold

#### Script 3: Filter by Length
```bash
./scripts/filter_by_length.sh 5000
```
**Purpose**: Filters scaffolds with length >= specified minimum
**Output**: `results/filtered_sequences.txt` - Filtered scaffold headers

#### Script 4: High-Quality Scaffolds
```bash
./scripts/high_quality_scaffolds.sh
```
**Purpose**: Identifies scaffolds meeting both length and coverage criteria
**Output**: `results/high_quality_scaffolds.txt` - High-quality scaffold list

#### Script 5: Extract Gene Names
```bash
./scripts/extract_genes.sh
```
**Purpose**: Extracts unique gene names from protein database
**Output**: `results/gene_names_sorted.txt` - Sorted unique gene names

#### Script 6: Search Proteins
```bash
./scripts/search_proteins.sh "kinase"
```
**Purpose**: Searches for proteins matching a keyword
**Output**: `results/protein_search_results.txt` - Matching protein entries

[TODO: Update the purpose and output descriptions based on your actual implementations]

### Running the Master Script
```bash
./scripts/run_analysis.sh ./Data/
```
**Purpose**: Runs all analyses in sequence and generates a comprehensive summary
**Output**:
- All result files from individual scripts
- `results/analysis_summary.txt` - Summary of all analyses with counts and timestamp

[TODO: Verify the above descriptions match your actual implementation]
